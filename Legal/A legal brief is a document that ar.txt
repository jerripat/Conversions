A legal brief is a document that argues one side of a case over the other[2][3]. It is a written legal argument presented to the court with the purpose of convincing the judge to rule in favor of your client[3]. Although the exact form of a brief may vary from case to case, there are some basic components that should appear in every brief[6]. These components include:

- **Heading**: This should include the name of the case, the court that decided it, the year it was decided, and the page on which it appears in the casebook[4][6].

- **Statement of Facts**: This section sets forth all of the key factual elements a court should use in making its decision[1]. It is important to use simple, clear language and to include only relevant facts[1].

- **Issue**: This section should identify the legal issue being addressed[2][5].

- **Rule of Law**: This section should explain the legal principle or rule that applies to the issue[4][5].

- **Argument**: This section should present your argument in support of your position with cited case law[3][5].

- **Conclusion**: This section should summarize the key points of the brief and request specific relief[1][2].

It is important to note that a legal brief should be written in a concise and clear manner, using legalese when appropriate[2]. Additionally, it is wise to have a more senior colleague proofread your work to catch any errors before submitting it to court officials[2].

Citing Legal Sources:
Citing legal sources in a legal brief is an essential part of writing a persuasive and effective document[4]. The most frequently used style manual for citing legal documents is The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation[1]. Here are some guidelines for citing legal sources in a legal brief:

- **Cases**: The citation should include the name of the case, an abbreviation for the legal series, the volume number, the name of the series, the page number, and the year of the decision[1][4][5]. For example, Morse v. Frederick, 551 U.S. 393 (2007) is a citation to a Supreme Court case which can be found in volume 551 of the United States Reports (U.S.) beginning on page 393[1].

- **Statutes**: The citation should include the name of the statute, the title number, the abbreviation of the code, the section number, and the year of the code[1][4][6]. For example, the citation for the Americans with Disabilities Act would be: Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. ยง 12101 et seq. (2012)[1].

- **Regulations**: The citation should include the name of the regulation, the title number, the abbreviation of the code, the section number, and the year of the code[1][4][6]. For example, the citation for the Code of Federal Regulations would be: 29 C.F.R. ยง 1630.2(j)(1)(ii) (2012)[1].

- **Law review articles**: The citation should include the author's name, the title of the article, the volume number, the name of the journal, the page number, and the year of publication[1][2][5]. For example, the citation for an article in the Harvard Law Review would be: John Doe, "The Constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act," 125 Harv. L. Rev. 1 (2012)[1].

It is important to note that the citation format may vary depending on the jurisdiction and the type of legal source being cited[1][5]. Therefore, it is essential to consult The Bluebook or other relevant citation manuals for specific guidelines on citing legal sources in a legal brief[1][2][5].
